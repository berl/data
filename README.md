# data

Add datasets for spacejam 2.0 here.


[**THIS SPREADSHEET**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CN7kn8ELg9dhVPDkeb7JB02NYYTNUEqfaKkO40yWDzM/edit?usp=sharing) contains links to all the data and many of the analyses from the first spacejam, including the **RNA-seq reference data and consensus clusters**.  Several of these files are shared in the "spacetx" slack workspace.  Please ask [Jeremy](mailto:jeremym@alleninstitute.org) to invite you if needed, or if you have any questions about data access for things in this table.
